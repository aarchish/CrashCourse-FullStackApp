Description

Today I Learned was a full-stack web application I built as a part of Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course "Crash Course: Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend!" 
It features a React front-end and a back-end powered by Supabase. 
Users can view all of the facts in the database as well as facts by category, can vote on facts they think are interesting or false 
(if a fact has more downvotes than upvotes it will be flagged as disputed) and upload their own fact. 
During development I was able to continue learning about React components, hooks, props, etc. and I'm excited to show you to the final product!
If you wish to check it out simply click on the Netlify deployment link above.

Usage

To upload a fact follow these steps:

Press the Share a Fact button to open the fact form
Enter your facts' text in 200 characters or less

Select a category
Press the Post button.

Down below you can see the fact I just created! 

Note that the fact "Human DNA is 99.9% identical from person to person" is disputed, as seen by the [DISPUTED !!] that precedes it.
For a fact to be disputed it must be voted false more than it was voted interesting. To vote on a fact simply press the üëç or ‚õîÔ∏è buttons as seen below as well.

Lastly, you can filter the facts in the database by their category type. 
Here we pressed the "TECHNOLOGY" button to view only facts that relate to technology.
